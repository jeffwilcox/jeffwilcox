## I work in the Open Source Office at Microsoft

### GitHub at Scale

A decade ago, I was a part of the team that started Microsoft's journey to releasing
open source on GitHub, and ever since, it's been a blast helping teams at Microsoft use,
contribute to, and release open source at scale.

I'm responsible for hacking together the early enterprise-scale GitHub tooling that we
use at Microsoft to let our employees, interns, and vendors join our GitHub orgs without
having to work through an admin.

These days, I'm super happy working to encourage Microsoft folks to contribute to open source
projects that are _not_ controlled by Microsoft, and am currently working on the Free and Open Source
Software Fund (FOSS Fund) program, letting employees decide which projects Microsoft should
sponsor through GitHub Sponsors.
