# Hi, I'm Jeff

I lead **Microsoft's Open Source Programs Office**. My team partners with experts
across Microsoft and the industry to make sure that we have everything in place
for Microsoft engineers and businesses to do everything from safely using open
source while complying with license obligations and contributing back to projects
to producing open source projects such as TypeScript and Visual Studio Code and
building healthy communities.

## Supporting the open source ecosystem

I care deeply about open source, licensing, and digital freedom. I proudly support
these important non-profits personally on an annual basis:

- [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org)
- [Software Freedom Law Center](https://softwarefreedom.org)
- [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)
- [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/)
- [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)
- [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org)
- [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org)
- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org)

_I also support many initiatives that I believe about relating to housing
affordability, regional charities in the greater Seattle, Washington area,
and more._

## GitHub at Scale

Staring in 2011, I was a part of the team that started Microsoft's journey to releasing
open source on GitHub, and ever since, it's been a blast helping teams at Microsoft use,
contribute to, and release open source at scale.

I was responsible for hacking together the early enterprise-scale GitHub tooling that we
use at Microsoft to let our employees, interns, and vendors join our GitHub orgs without
having to work through an admin while providing guardrails and help. Today we call that
project the [Microsoft Open Source Management Portal](http://github.com/microsoft/opensource-management-portal).
